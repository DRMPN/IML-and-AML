# Introduction to Machine Learning and Advanced Machine Learning
**The discipline consists of two parts:**
1. The part "Introduction to Machine Learning (Python)" discusses different types of machine learning, demonstrates practical examples how to solve various problems with machine learning methods using the Python programming language. The main focus is on regression problems, classification and clustering problems tasks.
2. The part "Advanced Machine Learning (Python)" shows how to reduce the feature set dimension in factor analysis. Further, the support vector machines, decision trees, model ensembles and another type of machine learning i.e. reinforcement learning are considered.
